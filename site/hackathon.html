                    <h3>2. Urban heat island effect</h3>
                    <p>Cities tend to be significantly hotter than nearby rural areas because urban materials such as concrete, asphalt, and brick absorb and retain heat throughout the day, then slowly release it at night. In contrast to the natural landscapes found in the countryside, urban environments often lack sufficient green spaces like parks, trees, and vegetation, which naturally cool the air through shade and evaporation.</p>
