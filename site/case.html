                    <h1>The Reason Why....</h1>
                    <p>I struggle to find recipes that fit my dietary preferences, skill levels, or cooking styles. I found that existing apps often lack features that promote community interaction and personalized experiences. I want to create a community that people could upload their own recipe on it even it is normal. I want this app for normal people who cook for their families, roommates, or just themselves.</p>
                    <p>Because not everyone is a professional chef—but everyone eats. Most recipe apps are too fancy that doesn’t reflect how real people cook every day. I want it is a place where everyone can share their own creations and tips without needing perfect lighting or high skills. It’s about real food, real kitchens, and building a community around the kind of cooking that happens every day, not just for the social media.</p>

                            <p>I am conducting research on digital recipe applications, with a particular focus on Epicurious and NYT Cooking. This study aims to explore the user experience, interface design, and overall functionality of these platforms. As part of my methodology, I have been analyzing user feedback sourced from various channels, including app store reviews, personal blogs, and culinary forums. This qualitative data provides insight into users' expectations, common frustrations, and the features that enhance or hinder their engagement with these cooking apps.</p>
